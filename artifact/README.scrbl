This is a README file for the artifact that accompanies "@|PAPER-TITLE|" in
POPL 2017.  If you have any questions, please email any (or all) of the
authors.

Our artifact is consists of a VM image that contains
@itemlist[
  @item{A copy of the POPL 2017 camera-ready}
  @item{A distribution of the Racket programming language}
  @item{The @racket[turnstile] library and its documentation}
 ]

The goals of this artifact are to
@itemlist[
  @item{Package the library associated with the paper.}
  @item{Provide runnable code for each stylized example in the paper.}
 ]


@; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section{Setting up and installing the artifact}

The artifact is available as a virtual machine appliance for VirtualBox.
Alternatively, you can download the @tt{popl2017-artifact} release from the
@tt{turnstile} @hyperlink[REPO-URL]{repository} on Bitbucket and follow the
instructions in @hyperlink[@file://[(build-path ARTIFACT
"README.md")]]{artifact/README.md}.  @margin-note{VM appliance:
@hyperlink[VM-URL]{[link]}}

To run the artifact image, open the given @tt{.ovf} file using the
@tt{File->Import Appliance} menu item. This will create a new VM
that can be launched after import. We recommend giving the VM at least
2GB of RAM.

The image is configured to automatically login to the @tt{artifact} user account.
The password for the account is also @tt{artifact}.
The account has root privileges using @tt{sudo} without a password.

@subsection{Paper Section 6}
The paper presents simplistic snippets of the MLish language implementation,
optimized for readability. The actual implementation can be found in the files
listed below. It fills in the gaps from the paper and in addition may differ
from the paper due to improved error message reported and a more efficient type
inference algorithm.

                @tt{-prog.rkt} example programs}]
           
@section[#:tag "tables"]{Tables from the paper}

We implemented two versions of each language:
@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          @item{a version using Racket, as described in Section 3 of the paper.
                These implementations can be found at:

                @file-url[(build-path MACROTYPES "examples")]}
          @item{a version using Turnstile, as described in Sections 4-6 of the
                paper. These implementations can be found at:

                @file-url[TURNSTILE-EXAMPLES]}]

The languages in each directory try to build and extend each other, and attempt
to reuse as much code as possible.

@subsection{Table 1}
Table 1 was compiled primarily using the
@hyperlink[@file://[POPL-EXAMPLES]]{Racket implementations} (#1 above).
Table 1 is still roughly accurate for the
@hyperlink[@file://[TURNSTILE-EXAMPLES]]{Turnstile versions} (#2), except that
Turnstile defines a few things, like @tt{Ï„=}, automatically.

@subsection{Table 2}

Column 1 in table 2 reports the exact line numbers of the
@hyperlink[@file://[TURNSTILE-EXAMPLES]]{Turnstile implementations} (#2 above).
They may have slightly changed since the paper was last edited.

Column 2 in table 2 roughly estimates the number of lines required to implement
each language, without reusing any other languages, by adding up the files for
the relevant languages from column 1. Column 2 only counts lines from files
that were @emph{entirely} needed to implement the language in question, and
excludes files from which only a few lines are reused. We rounded to 2
significant figures.

Column 3 tries to add up all the lines of code required by the
@hyperlink[POPL-EXAMPLES]{non-Turnstile implementations} (#1 above).
Since we programmed according to standard software development practices, and
grouped common operations in libraries, this was difficult to estimate
accurately. To get a rough idea, we simply added all the language
implementations and common library files together. We rounded to 2 significant
figures.

We used the following command to compute line counts:

@tt{wc -l <filename.rkt>}

but since the paper was published, it is now possible to count non-whitespace,
non-comment lines of code via:

@tt{raco sloc <filename.rkt>}

@subsection{Table 3}
