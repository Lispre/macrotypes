 - use it to validate given pred in define-symbolic
 - STARTED 2016-08-25
- implement assert-type, which adds to the assertion store
 - DONE 2016-08-25
- add polymorphism
 - regular polymorphism
- extend BV type with a size
 - requires BV-size-polymorpism?
- add Any type?

** Problem:

The following subtyping relation holds but is potentially unintuitive for a 
programmer:

(U Int Bool) <: (U CInt Bool)

** Possible Solutions:
1) leave as is
2) allow only symbolic arguments to user-facing U constructor
 - user-facing U constructor expands to U** flattening constructor,
   which then expands to internal U* constructor
 - disadvantage: an if expression will expose the internal U** constructor,
   since if may need to create a symbolic union from potentially concrete types

Choosing #1 for now.
