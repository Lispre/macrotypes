TODOs:
- add pred properties to types 
  and use it to validate given pred in define-symbolic
- implement assert-type, which adds to the assertion store

** Problem:

The following subtyping relation holds but is potentially unintuitive for a 
programmer:

(U Int Bool) <: (U CInt Bool)

** Possible Solutions:
1) leave as is
2) allow only symbolic arguments to user-facing U constructor
 - user-facing U constructor expands to U** flattening constructor,
   which then expands to internal U* constructor
 - disadvantage: an if expression will expose the internal U** constructor,
   since if may need to create a symbolic union from potentially concrete types

Choosing #1 for now.
