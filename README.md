- see `macrotypes/examples/README.md` for language reuse information

- tests are in `macrotypes/examples/tests/` and `turnstile/examples/tests/` directories

- run all tests (from test directory) with `racket run-all-tests.rkt`

- run just mlish tests (from test directory) with `racket run-all-mlish-tests.rkt`
